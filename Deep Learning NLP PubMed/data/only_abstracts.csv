"Abstract Nettle root is recommended for complaints associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We therefore conducted a comprehensive review of the literature to summarise the pharmacological and clinical effects of this plant material. Only a few components of the active principle have been identified and the mechanism of action is still unclear. It seems likely that sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), aromatase, epidermal growth factor and prostate steroid membrane receptors are involved in the anti-prostatic effect, but less likely that 5alpha-reductase or androgen receptors are involved. Extract and a polysaccharide fraction were shown to exert anti-inflammatory activity. A proprietary methanolic nettle root extract and particular fractions inhibited cell proliferation. Isolated lectins (UDA) were shown to be promising immunomodulatory agents, having also anti-viral and fungistatic effects. However, despite these in vitro studies it is unclear whether the in-vitro or animal data are a surrogate for clinical effects. The clinical evidence of effectiveness for nettle root in the treatment of BPH is based on many open studies. A small number of randomised controlled studies indicate that a proprietary methanolic extract is effective in improving BPH complaints. However, the significance and magnitude of the effect remains to be established in further confirmatory studies before nettle root treatment may be accepted in the guidelines for BPH treatment. The risk for adverse events during nettle root treatment is very low, as is its toxicity. Pre-clinical safety data remain to be completed.",A comprehensive review on the stinging nettle effect and efficacy profiles.

"Abstract For decades, the focus of managing autoimmune hypothyroidism has been on thyroxine replacement. Correcting lab parameters such as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) has been a primary goal. The increasing prevalence of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) continues to impact the quality of life in patients. We believe a holistic approach to this disease entity, considering its underlying complex etiopathogenesis, would benefit patients. Nutraceuticals are combinations of essential nutrients and are becoming a part of novel medical treatments despite the lack of regulation. This review aims to present a concise summary of recent developments regarding minerals such as zinc, selenium, magnesium, iron, and their potential clinical benefit as nutraceuticals in patients with HT. We have explored the potential benefits and associations of these minerals in HT and thyroid function. We reviewed relevant articles, metanalyses, and clinical trials in literature platforms such as PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar. Significant data found in the literature suggesting a potential health benefit of these minerals in HT though there were many studies to the contrary. Many trials demonstrated the restoration of residual symptoms, reversal of HT-associated thyroid morphological changes, and improvement in thyroid functions. Many of these trials lack statistical power due to the small sample sizes, and their external validity may be questionable due to unaccounted confounding factors. In our opinion, to support an evidence-based holistic clinical approach, further scientific evidence is needed. The association of these elements in thyroid function necessitates more large scale pragmatic trials to elucidate the benefits of nutraceuticals in HT.

"Abstract Background: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by high levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroid globulin antibody (TgAb) as well as infiltration of lymphocytes in thyroid. In recent years, metformin has been proven to be effective in a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

Methods: This study systematically explored the therapeutic effect of metformin on HT and its underlying mechanism by comprehensively utilizing methods including animal model, in vitro cell culture and differentiation, mRNA sequencing and 16S rRNA sequencing.

Findings: We found that metformin indeed had a therapeutic effect on mice with HT mainly by reducing TgAb and lymphocyte infiltration in thyroid tissue. In addition, metformin also significantly suppressed the number and function of Th17 cells and M1 macrophages polarization in HT mice. Furthermore, metformin can inhibit the differentiation and function of Th17 in vitro. The results of mRNA sequencing of thyroid tissue illustrated that the therapeutic effect of metformin on HT was mainly achieved by regulating immune pathways. 16S RNA sequencing of the intestinal flora found that the intestinal flora of HT mice differs significantly from that of the normal mice and also were altered by metformin treatment.

Interpretation: These experiments provided a preliminary theoretical basis for the clinical application of metformin in the treatment of HT.

"Abstract Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders linked to various systemic diseases ranging from obesity to cancers. The present line of management is insufficient as reports suggest that there is persistence of symptoms and poor adherence that makes the management of said disease challenging. Acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapies are proven to alleviate endocrine dysfunctions. However, reports on acupuncture and cupping therapy on hypothyroidism are very scarce. Here, we report 5 cases of hypothyroid patients aged between 38-44 yrs who were treated with acupuncture and fire cupping for a period of three months. At the baseline, the patients presented with either a weak, wiry or vacuum pulse which represents spleen Qi deficiency. Further, they presented with elevated levels of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and higher Body Mass Index (BMI). Acupuncture treatment at ST36, LI4, SP6, and BL20 was given bilaterally whilst CV4, LR3, LR4, SP9, ST40, SP10, GV4, KI3, ST12, and SI17 were punctured unilaterally. At the end of the time period of three months, patients progressed to normal levels of TSH, reduction in BMI and had succeeded in tapering their medication doses. Supplementing this, the patients reported marked improvement in other symptoms like fatigue, hair loss, and cold feet post-treatment. The effects were consistent even during the three month follow-up period post-interventions. The results encourage the utilization of acupuncture and fire cupping in the management of hypothyroidism. However, large scale studies are warranted to strengthen this recommendation.

"Abstract Thyroid dysfunction, affecting people of all ages, not only damages human growth and energy metabolism but is also comorbid with other illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and gastrointestinal disorders. With the increasing acceptance of alternative and complementary therapies, acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medical practice, has also been employed to address this problem. Analysing 29 clinical projects that were retrieved from 29 major digital databases and include 1757 patients aged 7-79 years from China, Italy, Korea, Macedonia and Russia, this narrative review offers an overview of the efficacy, and evaluated the safe and cost-effective use of acupuncture against hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism and thyroid-relevant illnesses. Findings indicated reductions in patient symptoms and improvements in biomarkers where acupuncture was used alone or in combination therapy. In addition to showing the role of acupuncture as an alternative and complementary medicine or as an adjunctive therapy for curative and rehabilitative purposes, more well-designed researches are needed to achieve reliable data.

"Abstract Awareness of physical activity (PA) constraints in patients with primary hypothyroidism on thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THR) is important. Hence, this cross-sectional matched case-control study aimed to determine PA and sports participation (SP) in patients with hypothyroidism on THR in comparison to control subjects. Accordingly, survey questions were selected from the National Survey on Injuries and Physical Activity in the Netherlands (IPAN), supplemented with questions related to self-reported clinical characteristics and exercise-related constraints (ERC) of patients. In total, 1,724 female patients (mean age 53.0 years ±11.6) and 1,802 controls (mean age 52.6 ± 13.2) were included. Compared to controls, patients were less likely to comply with the moderate-intensity PA guideline (OR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.611-0.803), although patients were more actively participating in sports (OR 1.40; 95% CI: 1.156-1.706). Two-thirds of patients reported that hypothyroidism was limiting their PA performance. These limitations were more pronounced in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) than in patients with hypothyroidism from other aetiology (OR 1.93; 95% CI: 1.518-2.457), representing disease-specific exercise intolerance. In order to establish effective intervention programmes to encourage regular PA in hypothyroid patients on THR with exercise intolerance, further research is warranted to better understand PA barriers.

"Abstract The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of studying acupuncture in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to pilot test the safety and explore benefits of a standardized acupuncture protocol designed to reduce pain and fatigue. Twenty-four patients with SLE were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of either acupuncture, minimal needling or usual care. Pain, fatigue and SLE disease activity were assessed at baseline and following the last sessions. Safety was assessed at each session. Fifty-two patients were screened to enroll 24 eligible and interested persons. Although transient side effects, such as brief needling pain and lightheadedness, were reported, no serious adverse events were associated with either the acupuncture or minimal needling procedures. Twenty-two participants completed the study, and the majority (85%) of acupuncture and minimal needling participants were able to complete their sessions within the specified time period of 5-6 weeks. 40% of patients who received acupuncture or minimal needling had >/=30% improvement on standard measures of pain, but no usual care patients showed improvement in pain.

"Abstract Endometriosis, a gynecological disease that affects reproductive age women is difficultly controlled in the long term by currently available treatments, prompting patients to adopt self-controlled interventions including dietary changes. The aim of this review is to provide evidence of how curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol can act as natural interventions to control endometriosis. The review followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A comprehensive search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to gather together all the articles that study the specific actions of curcumin, resveratrol, or quercetin in endometriosis pathophysiology. All types of study designs including experimental data were considered. Thirty articles, including a clinical trial, were included. For the assessment of the quality of the selected studies that globally have ""good quality"", the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and the SYRCLE ROB tool criteria were used. By acting on mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, invasion and adhesion, apoptosis, angiogenesis and glucose and lipid metabolism, curcumin, quercetin, and resveratrol showed to have beneficial effects, evidencing their potential application in the endometriosis treatment. However, future clinical studies are necessary to determine the real efficacy of these compounds in human endometriosis.

"Abstract Quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a major dietary flavonol found in diverse fruits and vegetables such as onions, cauliflower, apple skin, lettuce and chili peppers. In recent studies, quercetin is reported as a functional compound and shows a wide range of biological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties in obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and various cancers. However, to date, the therapeutic effect of quercetin on the progression of endometriosis, which is a common gynecological disease in reproductive-aged women and brings chronic pelvic pain and infertility, has not been examined in depth. Results of this study demonstrated that quercetin inhibited the proliferation and induced the cell cycle arrest in VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells. Furthermore, it induced cell apoptosis with DNA fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production. The effects accompanied down-regulation of ERK1/2, P38 MAPK and AKT signaling molecules. Additionally, the administration of quercetin indicated antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects on endometriosis autoimplanted mouse models. The mRNA expression of Ccnd1 significantly decreased in response to quercetin intraperitoneal injection when compared to that in vehicle-treated mice. The knockdown of CCND1 mRNA attenuated the proliferation with sub-G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and increased the apoptosis of VK2/E6E7 and End1/E6E7 cells. Furthermore, the treatment of quercetin induced miR-503-5p, miR-1283, miR-3714 and miR-6867-5p related to CCND1 in both cell lines and also stimulated miR-503-5p and miR-546 expression in the mouse model. Hence, quercetin may potentially act as a natural therapeutic to reduce and treat human endometriosis.

"Abstract Green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can inhibit angiogenesis and development of an experimental endometriosis model in mice, but it suffers from poor bioavailability. A prodrug of EGCG (pro-EGCG, EGCG octaacetate) is utilized to enhance the stability and bioavailability of EGCG in vivo. In this study, the potential of pro-EGCG as a potent anti-angiogenesis agent for endometriosis in mice was investigated. Homologous endometrium was subcutaneously transplanted into mice to receive either saline, vitamin E, EGCG or pro-EGCG treatment for 4 weeks. The growth of the endometrial implants were monitored by IVIS(®) non-invasive in vivo imaging during the interventions. Angiogenesis of the endometriotic lesions was determined by Cellvizio(®) in vivo imaging and SCANCO(®) Microfil microtomography. The bioavailability, anti-oxidation and anti-angiogenesis capacities of the treatments were measured in plasma and lesions. The implants with adjacent outer subcutaneous and inner abdominal muscle layers were collected for histological, microvessel and apoptosis examinations. The result showed that EGCG and pro-EGCG significantly decreased the growth of endometrial implants from the 2nd week to the 4th week of intervention. EGCG and pro-EGCG significantly reduced the lesion size and weight, inhibited functional and structural microvessels in the lesions, and enhanced lesion apoptosis at the end of interventions. The inhibition by pro-EGCG in all the angiogenesis parameters was significantly greater than that by EGCG, and pro-EGCG also had better bioavailability and greater anti-oxidation and anti-angiogenesis capacities than EGCG. Ovarian follicles and uterine endometrial glands were not affected by either EGCG or pro-EGCG. Vitamin E had no effect on endometriosis. In conclusion, pro-EGCG significantly inhibited the development, growth and angiogenesis of experimental endometriosis in mice with high efficacy, bioavailability, anti-oxidation and anti-angiogenesis capacities. Pro-EGCG could be a potent anti-angiogenesis agent for endometriosis.",Prodrug of green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate (Pro-EGCG) as a potent anti-angiogenesis agent for endometriosis in mice,2,endometriosis,"epigallocatechin-3-gallate, egcg",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22948799/
"Abstract Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a bioactive component of green tea, has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects on immune cells. EGCG is also shown to activate the metabolic regulator, adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Reports have also indicated that EGCG inhibits the immune-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway has been implicated in mesangial cell activation in lupus. Mesangial cells from MRL/lpr lupus-like mice are hyper-responsive to immune stimulation and overproduce nitric oxide (NO) and other inflammatory mediators when stimulated. In our current studies, we sought to determine the mechanism by which EGCG attenuates immune-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Cultured mesangial cells from MRL/lpr mice were pre-treated with various concentrations of EGCG and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon (IFN)-γ. EGCG activated AMPK and blocked LPS/IFN-γ-induced inflammatory mediator production (iNOS expression, supernatant NO and interleukin-6). Interestingly, EGCG attenuated inflammation during AMPK inhibition indicating that the anti-inflammatory effect of EGCG may be partially independent of AMPK activation. Furthermore, we found that EGCG effectively inhibited the immune-stimulated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway independently of AMPK, by decreasing phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting an alternate mechanism for EGCG-mediated anti-inflammatory action in mesangial cells. Taken together, these studies show that EGCG attenuated inflammation in MRL/lpr mouse mesangial cells via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for the use of EGCG to regulate inflammation and control autoimmune disease.   Keywords: AMPK, inflammation, lupus, metabolism, MRL/lpr

"Abstract
Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), albeit characterized by gait impairment, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence, in clinical diagnosis is poorly defined and is usually coexistent with other neurodegenerative diseases. Surgical operation with shunt implantation is the primary treatment but leads to variable outcomes. Recent studies demonstrated that the pathophysiology of iNPH may include both preceding cerebrovascular events and concomitant Alzheimer's dementia or dopaminergic degenerative neuropathology in patients’ brain. These factors not only help differentiate iNPH from its mimics but also associated with the extent of symptomatic improvement after surgery. In this review, we examined these mechanisms underlying the development of iNPH and the beneficial effects of shunt surgery. Furthermore, the increasing identification and importance of biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid and neural imaging could also predict the responsiveness of treatment. Finally, these progresses suggest that combination therapy would be necessary for iNPH treatment in the future.

"Conclusion
Shunt surgery improved short-distance walking, functional exercise capacity, functional strength, and voluntary walking. An exercise program did not affect these outcomes. Short-distance walking was weakly correlated with voluntary walking, indicating improved physical capacity does not directly translate to increased physical activity. Further research should address how interventions should be tailored to promote physical activity after shunt surgery.

"Conclusions
An additional effect of the 12-week HIFE-programme on the overall improvement according to the iNPH-scale after shunt surgery in iNPH was not shown. This could be due to high attrition rate. However, the long-term effect on balance and higher goal achievement indicate beneficial influences of supervised physical exercise.

"Abstract Thyroid dysfunction can compromise physical capacity. Here, we analyze the effects of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism on maximum swim time in rats subjected to acute forced swimming, as an indicator of anaerobic capacity. Animals were forced to swim against a load (5% of body weight) attached to the tail and were killed 48 hours after the last test. Hyperthyroid rats were treated with thyroxine (50 mug/100 g body weight, i. p. for 7 days). The hypothyroid group received 0.03% methimazole in the drinking water for 4 weeks. Thyroid state was confirmed by alterations in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and liver mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD) activity. Hyperthyroid rats presented significantly lower visceral fat mass (VFM) and higher food intake (p<0.05) with unchanged body weight. Maximum swim time (MST), glycogen content (skeletal muscle and liver), and leptin levels were lower while corticosterone was higher (p<0.05). In hypothyroid rats body weight was lower (p<0.05), without changes in VFM. Tested at 7-day intervals, MST was lower for tests 2, 3, and 4 (p<0.05). Muscle glycogen was higher in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (p<0.05), without changes in liver. Serum corticosterone was lower, while leptin was higher (p<0.05).

Current pandemics of SARS-CoV-2 represents a major health problem worldwide, with over four million cases and more than 300,000 deaths in the world. Development of effective therapy thus became an emergency. This report aims to highlight Resveratrol as possible therapeutic candidate in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antiviral efficacy of Resveratrol was demonstrated for several viruses, including coronavirus. Resveratrol was shown to mitigate the major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, including regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), stimulation of immune system and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release. It was also reported to promote SIRT1 and p53 signaling pathways and increase cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) immune cells. In addition, Resveratrol was demonstrated to be a stimulator of fetal hemoglobin and a potent antioxidant, by trapping reactive oxygen species (ROS).

"Abstract
Acupuncture is an important part of Chinese medicine that has been widely used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, acupuncture has been used as a complementary treatment for COVID-19 in China. However, the underlying mechanism of acupuncture treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear. Based on bioinformatics/topology, this paper systematically revealed the multi-target mechanisms of acupuncture therapy for COVID-19 through text mining, bioinformatics, network topology, etc. Two active compounds produced after acupuncture and 180 protein targets were identified. A total of 522 Gene Ontology terms related to acupuncture for COVID-19 were identified, and 61 pathways were screened based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Our findings suggested that acupuncture treatment of COVID-19 was associated with suppression of inflammatory stress, improving immunity and regulating nervous system function, including activation of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, cancer pathway, viral carcinogenesis, Staphylococcus aureus infection, etc. The study also found that acupuncture may have additional benefits for COVID-19 patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease and obesity. Our study revealed for the first time the multiple synergistic mechanisms of acupuncture on COVID-19. Acupuncture may play an active role in the treatment of COVID-19 and deserves further promotion and application. These results may help to solve this pressing problem currently facing the world.

"Abstract Since the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), research has focused on understanding the etiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Identifying and developing prophylactic and therapeutics strategies to manage the pandemic is still of critical importance. Among potential targets, the role of the gut and lung microbiomes in COVID-19 has been questioned. Consequently, probiotics were touted as potential prophylactics and therapeutics for COVID-19. In this review we highlight the role of the gut and lung microbiome in COVID-19 and potential mechanisms of action of probiotics. We also discuss the progress of ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19 that aim to modulate the microbiome using probiotics in an effort to develop prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. To date, despite the large interest in this area of research, there is promising but limited evidence to suggest that probiotics are an effective prophylactic or treatment strategy for COVID-19. However, the role of the microbiome in pathogenesis and as a potential target for therapeutics of COVID-19 cannot be discounted.

"Abstract About two third of the human microbial commensal community, namely the gut microbiota, is hosted by the gastrointestinal tract which represents the largest interface of the organism to the external environment. This microbial community co-evolved in a symbiotic relationship with the human beings. Growing evidence support the notion that the microbiota plays a significant role in maintaining nutritional, metabolic and immunologic homeostasis in the host. Microbiota, beside the expected role in maintaining gastrointestinal homeostasis also exerts metabolic functions in nutrients digestion and absorption, detoxification and vitamins' synthesis. Intestinal microbiota is also key in the correct development of the lymphoid system, 70% of which resides at the intestinal level. Available studies, both in murine models and humans, have shown an altered ratio between the different phyla, which characterize a"" normal"" gut microbiota, in a number of different disorders including obesity, to which a significant part of the studies on intestinal microbiota has been addressed so far. These variations in gut microbiota composition, known as dysbiosis, has been also described in patients bearing intestinal autoimmune diseases as well as type 1 diabetes mellitus, systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Being Hashimoto's thyroiditis the most frequent autoimmune disorder worldwide, the analysis of the reciprocal influence with intestinal microbiota gained interest. The whole thyroid peripheral homeostasis may be sensitive to microbiota changes but there is also evidence that the genesis and progression of autoimmune thyroid disorders may be significantly affected from a changing intestinal microbial composition or even from overt dysbiosis. In this brief review, we focused on the main features which characterize the reciprocal influence between microbiota and thyroid autoimmunity described in the most recent literature.

"Abstract
Epidemiological data show that allergic children have a different intestinal flora from healthy children with higher levels of Clostridia and lower levels of Bifidobacteria. Nonetheless, Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli are found more commonly in the composition of the intestinal flora of non-allergic children. Probiotics are ingested live microbes that can modify intestinal microbial populations in a way that benefits the host and they are represented mainly by Lactobacilli. Enhanced presence of probiotic bacteria in the intestinal microbiota is found to correlate with protection against atopy. There is also very promising evidence to recommend the addition of probiotics to foods for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases. Clinical improvement, especially in allergic rhinitis and immunoglobulin (Ig)E-sensitized (atopic) eczema, has been reported in most of the published studies. However, clinical benefit of probiotic therapy depends upon numerous factors, such as type of bacterium, dosing regimen, delivery method and other underlying host factors, e.g. the age and diet of the host. Selection of the most beneficial probiotic strain, the dose and the timing of supplementation still need to be determined. This review helps understanding of the role of probiotics in various allergic diseases, explaining laboratory and clinical data in light of recent literature.",Various effects of different probiotic strains in allergic disorders: an update from laboratory and clinical data,1,"allergy, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis","probiotic, lactobacillus, bifidum",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20345982/
"Abstract Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a kind of chronic diffuse connective tissue illness characterized by multisystem and multiorgan involvement, repeated recurrence and remission, and the presence of a large pool of autoantibodies in the body. Although the exact cause of SLE is not thoroughly revealed, accumulating evidence has manifested that intake of probiotics alters the composition of the gut microbiome, regulating the immunomodulatory and inflammatory response, which may be linked to the disease pathogenesis. Particularly, documented experiments demonstrated that SLE patients have remarkable changes in gut microbiota compared to healthy controls, indicating that the alteration of microbiota may be implicated in different phases of SLE. In this review, the alteration of microbiota in the development of SLE is summarized, and the mechanism of intestinal microbiota on the progression of immune and inflammatory responses in SLE is also discussed. Due to limited reports on the effects of probiotics supplementation in SLE patients, we emphasize advancements made in the last few years on the function and mechanisms of probiotics in the development of SLE animal models. Besides, we follow through literature to survey whether probiotics supplements can be an adjuvant therapy for comprehensive treatment of SLE. Research has indicated that intake of probiotics alters the composition of the gut microbiome, contributing to prevent the progression of SLE. Adjustment of the gut microbiome through probiotics supplementation seems to alleviate SLE symptoms and their cardiovascular and renal complications in animal models, marking this treatment as a potentially novel approach.
